\title{Creates a manhattanr object}
\source{
The pre-processing is mostly the same as the
  manhattan function from the
  \href{https://github.com/stephenturner/qqman}{\code{qqman}} package
}
\usage{
manhattanr(
  x,
  chr = "CHR",
  bp = "BP",
  p = "P",
  snp,
  gene,
  annotation1,
  annotation2,
  logp = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{data.frame} which must contain at least the following three
columns: \itemize{ \item{the chromosome number} \item{genomic base-pair
position} \item{a numeric quantity to plot such as a p-value or zscore} }}

\item{chr}{A string denoting the column name for the chromosome. Default is
\code{chr = "CHR"}. This column must be \code{numeric} or \code{integer}.
Minimum number of chromosomes required is 1. If you have X, Y, or MT
chromosomes, be sure to renumber these 23, 24, 25, etc.}

\item{bp}{A string denoting the column name for the chromosomal position.
Default is \code{bp = "BP"}. This column must be \code{numeric} or
\code{integer}.}

\item{p}{A string denoting the column name for the numeric quantity to be
plotted on the y-axis. Default is \code{p = "P"}. This column must be
\code{numeric} or \code{integer}. This does not have to be a p-value. It
can be any numeric quantity such as peak heights, bayes factors, test
statistics. If it is not a p-value, make sure to set \code{logp = FALSE}.}

\item{snp}{A string denoting the column name for the SNP names (e.g. rs
number). More generally, this column could be anything that identifies each
point being plotted. For example, in an Epigenomewide association study
(EWAS) this could be the probe name or cg number. This column should be a
\code{character}. This argument is optional, however it is necessary to
specify if you want to highlight points on the plot using the
\code{highlight} argument in the \code{\link{manhattanly}} function}

\item{gene}{A string denoting the column name for the GENE names. This column
could be a \code{character} or \code{numeric}. More generally this could be
any annotation information that you want to include in the plot. This
argument is optional.}

\item{annotation1}{A string denoting the column name for an annotation. This
column could be a \code{character} or \code{numeric}. This could be any
annotation information that you want to include in the plot (e.g. zscore,
effect size, minor allele frequency). This argument is optional.}

\item{annotation2}{A string denoting the column name for an annotation. This
column could be a \code{character} or \code{numeric}. This could be any
annotation information that you want to include in the plot (e.g. zscore,
effect size, minor allele frequency). This argument is optional.}

\item{logp}{If TRUE, the -log10 of the p-value is plotted. It isn't very
useful to plot raw p-values, but plotting the raw value could be useful for
other genome-wide plots, for example, peak heights, bayes factors, test
statistics, other "scores" etc.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object of class \code{manhattanr} with the following
  elements \describe{ \item{data}{processed data to be used for plotting}
  \item{xlabel}{The label of the x-axis which is determined by the number of
  chromosomes present in the data} \item{ticks}{the coordinates on the x-axis
  of where the tick marks should be placed} \item{labs}{the labels for each
  tick. This defaults to the chromosome number but can be changed in the
  \code{\link{manhattanly}} function } \item{nchr}{the number of unique
  chromosomes present in the data} \item{pName, snpName, geneName,
  annotation1Name, annotation2Name}{The names of the columns corresponding to
  the data provided. This information is used for annotating the plot in the
  \code{\link{manhattanly}} function } }
}
\description{
An object of class manhattanr includes all the needed information for
producing a manhattan plot. The goal is to seperate the pre-processing of the
manhattan plot elements from the graphical rendaring of the object, which
could be done using any graphical device including
\code{\link[plotly]{plot_ly}} and \code{\link[graphics]{plot}} in base
\code{R}.
}
\examples{
# HapMap dataset included in this package already has columns named P, CHR and BP
library(manhattanly)
DT <- manhattanr(HapMap)
class(DT)
head(DT[["data"]])

#include snp and gene information
DT2 <- manhattanr(HapMap, snp = "SNP", gene = "GENE")
head(DT2[["data"]])
